**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

**Project features:**
- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- Grid
- Javascript
- Adaptive design

**What's New:**

- Now you can like pictures
- Pictures can be added
- Pictures could be deleted
- Can't look through the small card? Not a problem with an imageviewer. Just click on it and the picture will be shown in full-size!
  
  **Plans to improve:**
  - Refactoring and cleaning up the code
  - Do not forget to update readme
  - Less bugs
  - More cool features
  - Do not forget to delete unnecessary comments
